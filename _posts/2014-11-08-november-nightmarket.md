maptimeLEX was again out at the monthly Night Market. Jessi Breen, Eric Huntley, and Ryan Cooper braved the cold weather to promote our [November 19th meetup on git/Github](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gitting-to-know-you-getting-to-know-all-about-git-tickets-14153588765) at the Plantory and the [November 22nd OpenStreetMap Editathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/621911581265097/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming). We spent the evening doing live edits of OpenStreetMap which excited the curiosities of many passersby. Being strategically located next to the lusciously fragrant portajohns didn't hurt either. And of course, we promoted maptimeLEX in style:

It was great chatting with folks from a variety of backgrounds and hope to see a few new faces at our upcoming meetups!
